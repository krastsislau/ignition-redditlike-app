## Summary:

- Next.js + Apollo client for GraphQL + Typescript
- Ant Design
- ...

## Subsciptions

These are implemented in a [separate PR](https://github.com/krastsislau/ignition-redditlike-app/pull/1).

## Project timeline

- Aug 28 evening: setting up stuff (initial Next.js + Apollo configuring)
- Aug 29:
    - 13:00-17:00: most of the work
    - 17:00-later: some extra beautifying and edge cases coverage
- Aug 30: a couple of adjustments and occasional GraphQL subscriptions testing

## Things to note

- I don't have prior experience with Apollo and GraphQL
- The only experience I have with Next is [my CV](https://rasteeslove.web.app/)
- Either way, the app works great
